An integral part of the evaluation process are the questionnaires. Students should be able to give meaningful answers to them and they should facilitate helpful feedback for the lecturers.

Assigning questionnaires to courses is possible through the "bulk assignment" functionality and manual assignment.

### Bulk assignment using the course type

On the bulk assignment page, staff users can select a number of questionnaires per course type (lecture, project seminar etc.), which are then assigned to all courses of that type.

The available course types are collected from the courses of the current semester. Only courses in the state 'new' are used, and only those will be affected by the bulk assignment.

If a staff user performs the bulk assignment a second time, it will overwrite all assignments for courses of all types for which at least one questionnaire has been selected.

### Manual assignment 

Independently from the bulk assignment, staff users (states: up to and including "approved") and editors (state: "prepared") can assign questionnaires to individual courses and their contributors on the course detail page.
