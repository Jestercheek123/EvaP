### What is EvaP?

EvaP is an Online Platform being used for evaluation of University Courses. It aims at helping to improve the quality of teaching by providing feedback on courses to Lecturers and University Management.

Students are provided with a Website to anonymously complete Questionnaires for the courses in which they are enrolled. After publishing the aggregated results of the Questionnaires are accessible for Students, Lecturers and University Management on the same Platform.

EvaP was developed at the Hasso Plattner Institute (HPI) in Potsdam, Germany, where it replaced the former used EvaJ in 2011, which became unmaintainable.

### What is this Wiki for?

As completely as possible this Wiki describes the Evaluation Process itself, the functionality of the Evaluation Platform and reasons for design decisions. It contains all important information for the administrating Student Representatives and for everyone who is interested in taking part in the Platform's development.

This is not a User Manual, but it provides some background knowledge about the concepts used within the project. A Step-by-Step Manual and an FAQ section for the different types of users (Students, Lecturers, Student Representatives) will be added later on.
