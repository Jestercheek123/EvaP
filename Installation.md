Installation
============

Vagrant
------------

Usually it's easiest to just use the Vagrant VM. For installation instructions using Vagrant, check out the [README](https://github.com/fsr-itse/EvaP#installation). This creates a fully working EvaP instance including a database and test data.

You can use EvaP at ``http://localhost:8000/`` on your host (an apache instance is available at ``http://localhost:8001/``), write code in your git repo, and access the VM with ``vagrant ssh``. Your git checkout is mounted in ``/vagrant`` there.

Use ``vagrant halt`` to shutdown the VM, and ``vagrant destroy`` to delete it.


Manual installation
--------------------

We recommend that you install the application into the directory ``/opt/evap`` according to the filesystem hierarchy standard. In the remaining steps, we will assume that this is your installation directory.

* Clone the repository or copy the files into that directory. The installation should be correct if the settings file has the path ``/opt/evap/evap/settings.py``.
* Follow the steps in the [script used to create the Vagrant VM](https://github.com/fsr-itse/EvaP/blob/master/deployment/provision_vagrant_vm.sh).
* Make sure that all files and directories are readable by the Apache web server. Additionally please make sure that the directory ``/opt/evap/evap/upload`` is writable by the web server.
* If you do not want to use the test data, you can use ``python manage.py createsuperuser`` to create a user to be able to log in.


Productive Environment: Settings
--------

The configuration of the application is done by creating a ``localsettings.py`` in the ``evap`` folder and overwriting the defaults from ``settings.py`` there. The defaults should be OK for most development purposes. For a production environment you should change the following settings:

- Choose an appropriate database and modify the ``default`` entry in the ``DATABASES`` settings. Please make sure that you use a database that supports transactions.
- Change the ``DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`` to an administrative mail address that is used as the sender of the mails generated by the system.
- Change ``MEDIA_ROOT`` to a directory that is writable by the web application. This directory will hold user-uploaded files.
- You should change the ``SECRET_KEY``.
- Finally, set ``DEBUG`` to ``False``.


Productive Environment: Apache 2 Configuration
----------------------------------------------

See [apache.template.conf](https://github.com/fsr-itse/EvaP/blob/master/deployment/apache.template.conf) for an example apache config.


Productive Environment: Updating to a new version
----------------------------------------------

See [update_production.sh](https://github.com/fsr-itse/EvaP/blob/master/deployment/update_production.sh).


Productive Environment: Kerberos Authentication
-----------------------------------------------

To use Kerberos as an authentication backend, do the following:

- run ``pip install django_auth_kerberos``

- copy the following to your ``localsettings.py`` and edit ``KRB5_REALM`` and ``KRB5_SERVICE`` according to your setup:

```
KRB5_REALM = 'EXAMPLE.COM'
KRB5_SERVICE = 'krbtgt@AS.EXAMPLE.COM'
INSTALLED_APPS += ('django_auth_kerberos',)
MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES += ('django_auth_kerberos.backends.KrbBackend',)
```

Productive Environment: Cron Configuration
------------------------------------------

EvaP has components which need to react to timed events. This behavior is implemented by running two cronjobs, which in turn trigger a management command. One should be run hourly and the other one daily.

For example you could use a /etc/cron.daily/evap like

    #!/bin/sh

    pushd  /opt/evap
    sudo -H -u evap /usr/bin/python manage.py send_reminders
    popd

And a /etc/cron.hourly/evap like

    #!/bin/sh

    pushd  /opt/evap
    sudo -H -u evap /usr/bin/python manage.py update_course_states
    popd
