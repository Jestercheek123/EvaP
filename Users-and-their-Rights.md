This page describes the different kind of roles a person can have and the rights corresponding to the roles. Note that these roles overlap, e.g. participants are by definition also users, and can also be contributors to a course (as a TA).

### User without an account
Users without an account cannot do anything useful. There is no way to sign up, and there are no public pages besides the login and FAQ pages.


### User with an account
Users with an account are able to login via Kerberos or a login key. They can see published results.


### Participant
Participants are students enrolling in a course. They can see the courses they enrolled in and can take part in the evaluation by answering questionnaires.


### Person responsible for the course
Each course has (at least) one person responsible for it (usually the lecturer). This person is able to edit the course which includes giving edit rights for the course to other persons and change which text answers are visible for which contributors. Responsibles can see all general text answers of the courses they are responsible for.

Initially, the person in the "Lecturer" column of the enrollment import is responsible for the course. Only managers can assign another person to this role.


### Contributor
A contributor is any person who is added to have teaching roles in a course (lecturers, tutors, etc., including the responsible person). They can see at least all text answers about themselves, and general text answers about the course if an editor gave them the respective text answer visibility rights.


### Editor
An editor is a contributor who got assigned edit rights for a course by another editor of this course. The responsible person is always an editor.


### Delegate
All persons with edit rights for a course can assign delegates on their settings page. Delegates have the combined edit rights for courses of all people they are representing. They can also see all results of the people they are representing.


### Managers
Responsible for the evaluation system are the managers. They work as administrators of the system and have full edit rights for users, courses and questionnaires, and can add and edit Semesters, run the enrollment data import, edit email templates and manage reward points.


### Reviewers
Reviewers support the managers during the text answer review process. They can access all results and text answers but have no edit rights besides the text answer review.


### Grade publisher
Grade publishers are assigned by managers and are allowed to use the grade publishing functionality.
