This page describes the different kind of roles a person can have and the rights corresponding to the roles. Note that these roles overlap, e.g. a student representative is always a user and usually a participant, and can also be a contributor to a course (as an TA).

### User without an account
Users without an account cannot do anything useful. There is no way to sign up, and there are no public pages besides the login and FAQ pages.


### User / _Benutzer_
Users are able to login via Kerberos or a login key. They can see all published results.


### Participant / _Teilnehmer_
Participants are students enrolling in a course. They can see the courses they enrolled in and can take part in the evaluation by answering questionnaires.


### Person responsible for the course / _Lehrveranstaltungs-Verantwortlicher_
Each course has exactly one person responsible for it (usually the lecturer). He is able to edit the course which includes giving edit rights for the course to other persons. He has a profile where he can add delegates for himself. He can see all comments on all contributors of the course he is responsible for.

Initially, the person in the "Lecturer" column of the enrollment import is responsible for the course. Only the FSR can assign another person to this role.


### Contributor / _Mitwirkender_
A contributor is any person who is added to have teaching roles in a course (lecturers, tutors, etc., including the responsible person). He can see all comments on himself.


### Delegate / _Stellvertreter_
All persons with edit rights for a course can assign delegates. A Delegate has the combined edit rights for courses of all people he or she is representing.


### Student representative / _FSR-Mitglied_
Responsible for the evaluation system are the student representatives. For convenience reasons the student representatives are also called (the) FSR for short (adopted from the representative's name at Hasso Plattner Insitute). They work as administrators of the system and have full edit rights for users, courses and questionnaires, and can add and edit Semesters, run the enrollment data import and edit email templates.
