EvaP sends the following emails automatically:
* "Publishing Notice" - Information email to all participants and contributors of a course after the results are published
* "Login Key Created" - Email containing the login key for an external user
* "Student Reminder" - Reminder email to all participants that have not evaluated yet
* "Editor Review Notice" - Request email to all persons responsible (and all persons with edit rights in CC) to complete the information of a course (e.g. contributors and their questionnaires)
* "Evaluation Started" - Email informing participants about the start of an evaluation
* "Editor Review Reminder" - Email reminding editors to prepare the evaluation

For all of these, templates with placeholders exist. The placeholders are replaced by the system appropriately. Finally, the emails are sent out to the individuals concerned.

The templates can be viewed and edited by managers.

Apart from these automatically sent emails, there is also the possibility to manually sent emails (arbitrary subject and content) to all participants of a course and/or all participants who didn't vote yet and/or all people with edit rights (with their delegates in CC) and/or all contributors (with their delegates in CC). This can be done by managers from the semester overview.
