EvaP sends the following emails automatically:
* "Publishing Notice" - Information email to all participants and contributors of a course after the results are published by FSR
* "Login Key Created" - Email containing the login key for an external user
* "Student Reminder" - Reminder email to all participants that have not evaluated yet
* "Lecturer Review Notice" - Request email to all persons responsible (and all persons with edit rights in CC) to complete the information of a course (e.g. contributors and their questionnaires)

For all of these, templates with placeholders exist. The placeholders are replaced by the system appropriately. Finally, the emails are sent out to the individuals concerned.

The templates can be viewed and edited in the FSR perspective.

Apart from these automatically sent emails, there is also the possibility to manually sent emails (arbitrary subject and content) to all participants of a course and/or the persons responsible (including all contributors with edit rights in CC) and/or all contributors. This can be done by the FSR from the semester overview.
