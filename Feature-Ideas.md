This is a list of features which could be implemented but are not necessary for the current use cases of the platform:
- It would be nice to have a functionality to also evaluate other topics and people (e.g. admins, facility management, ...) who don't have a direct relation to specific lectures.
- It would be nice to have a functionality to split an evaluation into sub-evaluations to get feedback during the semester as well, e.g. for midterm evaluation of some courses.
The result of a course's evaluation will then be a combination of all sub-results.
